## this is the project where a database has to be queried in order to get the result using a llm

this would change as the project progresses.

### first i tried doing this using azure but since tutorials were on azure went with it.

az.py connects to the azure thing.
multi_part.py does the multi part upload.
byte_fetch.py does the multi part download.
